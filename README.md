About
=====

Tag-based document manager with single file storage.
Actually, it should be able contain any files but I develop it
to handle PDF files generally. Program should store all documents in
one file, opposed to (known to me) already existing managers.
Thus it's easy to copy database to another machine without
pain. Backups should be easy too.

Large list of all documents organized not with folders but
with tags, where single document may have as many tags attached
as database owner wants. Each document besides tags have other
metadata such as its authors, journal, publishing date and--
I haven't decided yet what else.


Status
======

Currently it's not even alpha version, it's in pre-prototype state.
Although big picture should remain the same.
